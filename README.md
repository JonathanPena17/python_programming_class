Refactoring and extending the cannon project
Things to be implemented:

2. Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
3. Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
4. Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
5. Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.
