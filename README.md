Refactoring and extending the cannon project

Things to be implemented:
1. Implement various types of projectiles.
2. Transform the cannon into a moving tank. (Will move left/right on the ground)
3. Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
4. Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.
